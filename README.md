# Software Evolution

Assignments for the Software Evolution course of the University of Amsterdam.

The Rascal project for the first assignment series can be found in `series1/`. The test projects for this assignment reside in the subdirectory `projects/`. 
In order to run the function main(), the project `series1`, and both projects in the `projects/` subdirectory have to be available to Eclipse.

In order to run the analysis, open a rascal terminal for the project `series1`, and run:

```rascal
import Main;
main();
```
